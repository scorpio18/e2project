* e2

e2 is a small Erlang library that helps you write better software in less time.

- Erlang is hands down the best general purpose language for writing quality
  software using fewer lines of code
- It's not always obvious how to use Erlang to do this
- e2 makes it obvious!

If you think the first point is controversial, take a closer look at e2 before
settling the issue in your mind. It may take some time and effort before all
the pieces come together -- but isn't the promise tempting!
